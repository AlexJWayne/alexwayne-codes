  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">GLSL Shader Slides</h2>
  <p>
    I presented at my local makerspace on shaders. I had recently discovered
    them myself, and became fascinated by how they turn code and math into art.
    But they also turn the the classic rendering paradigm that I knew of at the
    time on its head: instead of rendering an object into pixels, you ask a
    program what color this pixel right here is.
  </p>
  <p>
    This presentation explains the basics of how it works and each example is
    itself a live WebGL shader.
