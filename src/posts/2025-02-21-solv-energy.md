The work I do by day is for [SOLVEnergy](https://solvenergy.com).

We have developed a software platform that tracks the construction of utility scale solar power plants. Then we take them live and monitor, and report on, their performance.

Here's a map of installed components in a demo project.

I can't show too much since it's proprietary for our clients and internal use, but I can say, after working on for a number of years, it's pretty cool.
