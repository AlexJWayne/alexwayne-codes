[TypeGPU Shader Canvas](https://github.com/AlexJWayne/typegpu-shader-canvas) is an open source library that makes it easy to render TypeScript based fragment shaders directly to a web based canvas element through a WebGPU pipeline. Just call `createShaderCanvas()` with a canvas reference and a shader function and that's it. It serves as an quick onramp for getting started with WebGPU and TypeGPU.
  
This is, of course, only possible because of the amazing [TypeGPU library](https://docs.swmansion.com/TypeGPU/).
